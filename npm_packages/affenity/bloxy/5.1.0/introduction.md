## Introduction

Welcome to bloxy! This module is currently in v4 alpha, and not all of the planned features
are implemented yet. I'm thankful that you've chosen to use bloxy, which is a great
open-source project, with a huge coverage of the Roblox Web API. 

bloxy was originally created because I did not like using roblox-js, because of how
things needed to be called and more. Bloxy was created to make it easier to use the Web API,
due to being object-oriented, and by having self-explanatory method/property names.

This makes it a lot easier to deal with Roblox's API, at least that's how I feel for it. If you ever
have any features / suggestions / issues about/with bloxy, please be sure to post these on the GitHub repository. Link: https://github.com/Visualizememe/bloxy
