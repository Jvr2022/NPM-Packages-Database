== Buzz: A Node.js Command Line Program to Keep Your App Running Indefinitely; Like the Program Forever

Buzz is a command line program that can kill your app routinely and restart it. 
It'll will also restart your app if it dies. It's a lot like the other Node.js
program link:https://github.com/indexzero/forever[Forever].

It's much simpler than Forever. Approximately 50 lines of CoffeeScript code.
It displays your apps output to STDOUT and also displays any of your apps
STDERR output in red.


=== Usage

Install it via npm:
----
npm install buzz
----

Then run:
----
buzz 240 your_cool_app param1 param2
----

The first parameter to buzz is the time in seconds that it'll be killed and
restarted. So, `your_cool_app` would be killed and restarted after four minutes.

If you don't want buzz to kill your app, but you want it to bring it back to
life if it dies, run:
----
buzz your_cool_app param1 param2
----

You can test buzz by running his the app `buzz_test`:
----
buzz_test
----

`buzz_test` runs the app `smarty_pants` that spews out random facts to you and
taunts you. Occasionally `smarty_pants` will commit suicide, but buzz will
bring him back to life.

`buzz_test` ends up actualy just running the following command:
----
buzz 10 smarty_pants 2000 0.15
----

Which will kill smarty pants every 10 seconds and bring him back to life. Also,
every two seconds, smarty pants will spit out a random fact. Approximately, every
13 seconds smarty pants will take his own life, but Buzz will bring him back.


=== Motivation

I have a command line app that is nasty to debug. It's working fine for the first 
five minutes or so. Thus, Buzz was born. Instead of fixing the bug, I wanted
to make this. =)

But really, it's utility is that it's a much simpler Forever.

The name comes from Buzz Lightyear in the movie Toy Story. His popular phrase was: To infinity and beyond!
